# DrawDemo

This is a personal project that was inspired by the game "A Fake Artist Goes To New York." I wanted to see if I could make a game multiplayer like a Jackbox Party Pack game. I also wanted to make the frontend in React as it had the most flexibility in developing the communications I wanted. This project was originally started before Covid and the idea was to play if with other in my office, but once Covid changed the workspace and my personal workload increased, this project did not get more done to it. 

Fortunately, it is a working project and does have multiplayer features, so I am proud of the work that did get completed and I'm happy to share it with you.
